## 💻 Exercises: Day 11

### Exercises: Level 1

1. Declare a function _add_two_numbers_. It takes two parameters and it returns a sum.
2. Area of a circle is calculated as follows: area = π x r x r. Write a function that calculates _area_of_circle_.
3. Write a function called add_all_nums which takes arbitrary number of arguments and sums all the arguments. Check if all the list items are number types. If not do give a reasonable feedback.
4. Temperature in °C can be converted to °F using this formula: °F = (°C x 9/5) + 32. Write a function which converts °C to °F, _convert_celsius_to-fahrenheit_.
5. Write a function called check-season, it takes a month parameter and returns the season: Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.
6. Write a function called calculate_slope which return the slope of a linear equation
7. Quadratic equation is calculated as follows: ax² + bx + c = 0. Write a function which calculates solution set of a quadratic equation, _solve_quadratic_eqn_.
8. Declare a function named print_list. It takes a list as a parameter and it prints out each element of the list.
9. Declare a function named reverse_list. It takes an array as a parameter and it returns the reverse of the array (use loops).

```py
print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(reverse_list1(["A", "B", "C"]))
# ["C", "B", "A"]
```

10. Declare a function named capitalize_list_items. It takes a list as a parameter and it returns a capitalized list of items
11. Declare a function named add_item. It takes a list and an item parameters. It returns a list with the item added at the end.

```py
food_staff = ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk'];
print(add_item(food_staff, 'Meat'))     # ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk','Meat'];
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9];
print(add_item(numbers, 5))      [2, 3, 7, 9, 5]
```

12. Declare a function named remove_item. It takes a list and an item parameters. It returns a list with the item removed from it.

```py
food_staff = ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk'];
print(remove_item(food_staff, 'Mango'))  # ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Milk'];
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9];
print(remove_item(numbers, 3))  # [2, 7, 9]
```

13. Declare a function named sum_of_numbers. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the numbers in that range.

```py
print(sum_of_numbers(5))  # 15
print(sum_all_numbers(10)) # 55
print(sum_all_numbers(100)) # 5050
```

14. Declare a function named sum_of_odds. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the odd numbers in that range.
15. Declare a function named sum_of_even. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the even numbers in that - range.

### Exercises: Level 2

1.  Declare a function named evens_and_odds . It takes a positive integer as parameter and it counts number of evens and odds in the number.

```py
    print(evens_and_odds(100))
    # The number of odds are 50.
    # The number of evens are 51.
```

1. Call your function factorial, it takes a whole number as a parameter and it return a factorial of the number
1. Call your function _is_empty_, it takes a parameter and it checks if it is empty or not
1. Write different functions which take lists. They should calculate_mean, calculate_median, calculate_mode, calculate_range, calculate_variance, calculate_std (standard deviation).

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Write a function called is_prime, which checks if a number is prime.
1. Write a functions which checks if all items are unique in the list.
1. Write a function which checks if all the items of the list are of the same data type.
1. Write a function which check if provided variable is a valid python variable
1. Go to the data folder and access the countries-data.py file.

- Create a function called the most_spoken_languages in the world. It should return 10 or 20 most spoken languages in the world in descending order
- Create a function called the most_populated_countries. It should return 10 or 20 most populated countries in descending order.
