### Exercises: Level 1
 1. What is the most frequent word in the following paragraph?
```py
    paragraph = 'I love teaching. If you do not love teaching what else can you love. I love Python if you do not love something which can give you all the capabilities to develop an application what else can you love.
```

```sh
    [
    (6, 'love'),
    (5, 'you'),
    (3, 'can'),
    (2, 'what'),
    (2, 'teaching'),
    (2, 'not'),
    (2, 'else'),

    (1, 'capabilities'),
    (1, 'application'),
    (1, 'an'),
    (1, 'all'),
    (1, 'Python'),
    (1, 'If')
    ]
```

2. The position of some particles on the horizontal x-axis are -12, -4, -3 and -1 in the negative direction, 0 at origin, 4 and 8 in the positive direction. Extract these numbers from this whole text and find the distance between the two furthest particles.

```py
points = ['-1', '2', '-4', '-3', '-1', '0', '4', '8']
sorted_points =  [-4, -3, -1, -1, 0, 2, 4, 8]
distance = 8 -(-4) # 12
```

### Exercises: Level 2

1. Write a pattern which identifies if a string is a valid python variable

    ```sh
    is_valid_variable('first_name') # True
    is_valid_variable('first-name') # False
    is_valid_variable('1first_name') # False
    is_valid_variable('firstname') # True
    ```

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Clean the following text. After cleaning, count three most frequent words in the string.

    ```py
    sentence = '''%I $am@% a %tea@cher%, &and& I lo%#ve %tea@ching%;. There $is nothing; &as& mo@re rewarding as educa@ting &and& @emp%o@wering peo@ple. ;I found tea@ching m%o@re interesting tha@n any other %jo@bs. %Do@es thi%s mo@tivate yo@u to be a tea@cher!?'''

    print(clean_text(sentence));
    I am a teacher and I love teaching There is nothing as more rewarding as educating and empowering people I found teaching more interesting than any other jobs Does this motivate you to be a teacher
    print(most_frequent_words(cleaned_text)) # [(3, 'I'), (2, 'teaching'), (2, 'teacher')]
    ```
