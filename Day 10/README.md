## 💻 Exercises: Day 10

### Exercises: Level 1

1. Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
2. Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
3. Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

   ```py
     #
     ##
     ###
     ####
     #####
     ######
     #######
   ```

4. Use nested loops to create the following:

   ```sh
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   ```

5. Print the following pattern:

   ```sh
   0 x 0 = 0
   1 x 1 = 1
   2 x 2 = 4
   3 x 3 = 9
   4 x 4 = 16
   5 x 5 = 25
   6 x 6 = 36
   7 x 7 = 49
   8 x 8 = 64
   9 x 9 = 81
   10 x 10 = 100
   ```

6. Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.
7. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers
8. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers
   
### Exercises: Level 2
    
1.  Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.

   ```sh
   The sum of all numbers is 5050.
   ```

1. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

    ```sh
    The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
    ```

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Go to the data folder and use the [countries.py](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries.py) file. Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word _land_.
1. This is a fruit list, ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop.
2. Go to the data folder and use the [countries_data.py](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries-data.py) file. 
   1. What are the total number of languages in the data
   2. Find the ten most spoken languages from the data
   3. Find the 10 most populated countries in the world
