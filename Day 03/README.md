## 💻 Exercises - Day 3

1. Declare your age as integer variable
2. Declare your height as a float variable
3. Declare a variable that store a complex number
4. Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of this triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

```py
    Enter base: 20
    Enter height: 10
    The area of the triangle is 100
```

5. Write a script that prompts the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle (perimeter = a + b + c).

```py
Enter side a: 5
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 3
The perimeter of the triangle is 12
```

6. Get length and width of a rectangle using prompt. Calculate its area (area = length x width) and perimeter (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))
7. Get radius of a circle using prompt. Calculate the area (area = pi x r x r) and circumference (c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
8. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2
9. Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope and [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20Euclidean%20distance,being%20called%20the%20Pythagorean%20distance.) between point (2, 2) and point (6,10) 
10. Compare the slopes in tasks 8 and 9.
11. Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is going to be 0.
12. Find the length of 'python' and 'dragon' and make a falsy comparison statement.
13. Use _and_ operator to check if 'on' is found in both 'python' and 'dragon'
14. _I hope this course is not full of jargon_. Use _in_ operator to check if _jargon_ is in the sentence.
15. There is no 'on' in both dragon and python
16. Find the length of the text _python_ and convert the value to float and convert it to string
17. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check if a number is even or not using python?
18. Check if the floor division of 7 by 3 is equal to the int converted value of 2.7.
19. Check if type of '10' is equal to type of 10
20. Check if int('9.8') is equal to 10
21. Writ a script that prompts the user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?

```py
Enter hours: 40
Enter rate per hour: 28
Your weekly earning is 1120
```

22. Write a script that prompts the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume a person can live hundred years

```py
Enter number of years you have lived: 100
You have lived for 3153600000 seconds.
```

23. Write a Python script that displays the following table

```py
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 4 8
3 1 3 9 27
4 1 4 16 64
5 1 5 25 125
```
